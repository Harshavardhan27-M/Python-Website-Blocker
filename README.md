# Python-Website-Blocker
A handy program that may boost a programmer's productivity by blocking user-specified websites during a certain period of 
time in a day.

# Language
  **Python 3.6**
  
# Usage 
  You can either manually run the Python script in your command line(Windows) or terminal(Linus/Mac), or better yet, simply schedule
  a daemon and let the script run once the computer starts. My program is intended to be run (be active) all the time.
  
  I will recommend using **launchd** if you're a Mac user, since this allows the process/daemon to run immediately right after you 
  wake up your machine from the sleep mode. Here's a great **[tutorial for launchd](http://www.launchd.info/)** and it walks you 
  through how to configure the **property list** on Mac, which is a special XML file.
